<li><h2 style ="color:yellow">Faculty of Business Administration & Economics & Political Science</h2></li>
<p><h3>The Faculty is offering three bachelor’s degrees: Business, Economics and Political Science.
 It comprises three academic departments: Business Administration which offers a Bachelor of Business Studies Honours degree,
 Economics which offers a Bachelor of Science Honours degree and Political Science which offers a Bachelor of Arts Honours degree.
 The focus of the Faculty is to offer up-to-date degrees which have a solid theoretical base and a global as well as an area-specific outlook.

The British University in Egypt was established in 2005 by Presidential Decree as the result of an inter-governmental agreement.
 It is an Egyptian private university within the framework of Egyptian educational
 law and regulations providing a British style of education with an ethos consistent with UK quality assurance and academic standards.
 As such, 
the BUE has made great progress in its short history. 
It has achieved a significant number of the aims set out in its first two Strategic Plans despite Egypt’s political upheavals,
 resulting economic challenges and national “gap year” in student intake. 
This new Strategic Plan commits us to continuing the achievement of BUE’s aims,
 enhancing its planned institutionalization.
 It identifies a number of key strategic areas and objectives 
and sets strategic and enabling targets that will ensure the continued success and further development of the University. 
Implementation plans,
 developed within the framework of the approved strategy, 
will be regularly monitored with annual reports to ensure their effectiveness.</h3></p>

<li><h2 style ="color:yellow">Faculty of Dentistry</h2></li>
<p><h3>The British University in Egypt, Faculty of Dentistry is committed
 to graduate dentists who are fully aware of their place and duties in society and are characterized
 by theoretical knowledge, clinical skills and a well-rounded personality. This means the dental graduate 
will be provided with professional knowledge of different
 dental fields of specialization, contemporary applications, and latest developments in dentistry as well as the dental skills 
necessary to deliver this knowledge to patients in terms of proper diagnosis,
 treatment planning, and execution. All this takes place within a framework of ethics while keeping the 
welfare of their patients at the forefront of their thoughts.
The methods of instruction at our Faculty include lectures, tutorials, seminars, practical, 
laboratory technical work, demonstrations, and specialised clinics for treatment of patients under staff supervision.
The teaching, clinical training, and assessment are geared to developing students’ 
analytical and problem-solving skills. Problem-based learning (PBL) will be introduced.
 This involves the presentation of a clinical problem to students that they 
will analyse and then look for the needed information themselves. 
This will train the students to be independent learners, 
an important trait to acquire for survival in the contemporary rapidly developing world.
 Assignments and research projects will be given strong emphasis in the curriculum. Teaching,
 learning and assessment will be progressive throughout the programs to encourage the transition from dependent
 to independent learning so that the graduates become increasingly self-reliant and responsible for their own learning.
